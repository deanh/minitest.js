0.2.0:
* Proper stack traces for errors
* Fs and Es for failures and errors as the tests run
* Optional stack traces for failures (via a constant flag)
* CamelCase everything. This breaks the API, but it was weird, needed to be done sooner,
  and should be easy to fix

0.1.4:
* Fixed messaging bugs
